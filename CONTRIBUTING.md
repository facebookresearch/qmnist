# Contributing to QMNIST
We want to make contributing to this project as easy 
and transparent as possible.

## Development considerations

The most important part of this project are of course the data files containing the QMNIST digits and labels.  It is important to understand that, in the interest of future reproducibility, these data files are frozen and cannot be modified. The only way to update the QMNIST data files to fix a serious error would be to release new data files under a new name. On the other hand, the code tnd the documentation can receive useful updates. For instance, the code that creates the qmnist files can be updated for portability as long as it regenerates exactly the same data files; the documentation can be made clearer or corrected for accuracy; etc.
